known issues
------------   
###focus areas
- rails testing (rspec)
- adding rails calls
 
###high priority
- rails links not matched up

###low priority
- nav tags need ul and li items added for proper semantics in application.html.erb
- media queries are completely incomplete, currently only changes .container width, probably does not work in all browsers equally, certainly not tested.
- Only tested in Safari with any completeness
- logo only works in safari perfectly
