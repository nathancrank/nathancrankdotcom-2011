###v0.3 Daft Downed Duck   
  
----------------  
  
#Welcome
This is the working repo for the code for my website, [nathancrankdotcom](http://nathancrank.com/). The site is written with Ruby on Rails, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I'm trying to keep the code neat and clean as I go. I'm trying to design to maximize performance and compatibility with a wide range of devices.
  
I can't imagine the whole of what im releasing being particularly useful for anyone, however snippets of it might be useful for those getting started with rails (like myself!).
