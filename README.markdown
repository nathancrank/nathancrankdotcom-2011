###v0.2 Champagne Chugging Chimp   
  
----------------  
  
Welcome
=======  
This is the code for my website, [nathancrankdotcom](http://nathancrank.com/), as it is posted on the internet currently. I figured why not post it on github. So I did.  

Feel free to let me know what you think, good and bad. Remember, Im a bit of rails noob.

Also, this currently is kind of an abuse of the use of rails seeing as it serves up one static page basically, but its more of a long term design decision.
  
The site is written with Ruby on Rails, and a whole bunch of other stuff. I'm trying to keep the code neat and clean as I go. I'm trying to design to maximize performance and compatibility with a wide range of devices.
  
Some day I might actually make something out of this file.    
  
I can't imagine the whole of what im releasing being particularly useful for anyone, however snippets of it might be useful for those getting started with rails (like myself!).  
  
Currently the site is pretty basic, but it is a never ending project.
