###v0.1 Barely Breathing Baboon  
  
----------------  
  
Welcome
=======  
This is the code for my website, as it is posted on the internet currently. I figured why not post it on github. So I did.  
  
Some day I might actually make something out of this file.    
  
I can't imagine the whole of what im releasing being particularly useful for anyone, however snippets of it might be useful for those getting started with rails (like myself!).
