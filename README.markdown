###v0.1 Barely Breathing Baboon  
  
----------------  
  
Welcome
=======  
This is the code for my website, as it is posted on the internet currently. I figured why not post it on github. So I did.  
  
The site is written for Ruby on Rails.
  
Some day I might actually make something out of this file.    
  
I can't imagine the whole of what im releasing being particularly useful for anyone, however snippets of it might be useful for those getting started with rails (like myself!).  
  
Currently the site is pretty basic, but it is a never ending project.

Technologies
============  
I will create a comprehensive list here with all frameworks and gems and etc used to create the site, with proper attribution, url and license information. I apologize for not having this ready already.
